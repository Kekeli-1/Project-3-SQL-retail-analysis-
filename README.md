# SQL Retail Sales & Inventory Analysis
This project analyzes a dataset of over 10,000 products(some duplicated across different stores) using SQL to uncover key 
business insights across sales, inventory, and pricing performance.

# Tools Used
- SQL (via Dbeaver)

# Key Questions Answered
1. Which products experienced stockouts the most but have consistent demand?
2. Which products were promoted and how did that affect their sales?
3. What are the top selling products across all stores?
4. How do products are priced higher than its competitors but have low sales volume?
5. Which products are frequently out of stock and need better inventory plan?
6. Which months generated the highest sales?
   AND many others

# Insights and Recommendation
1. High stockout frequency(ie products 4214,1949,8688,3781) These are high-priority products. Safety
   stock levels are to be ensured.
2. Promotional campaigns only slightly increased sales($1,394,152 with promotion vs. $1,389,986 without). Promotions have
   minimal impact. Consider targeting better products or changing the promo strategy.
3. Over 10,000 products analyzed, products like 4382 had a total sales quantity of 889 followed by 5354,and 9368. Store
   specific trends must be conscidered when restocking and pricing.
4. Products 1017,1034,1054,1122,1126 are priced above competitors but show low sales volume. Revise pricing strategy or offer
   buddle deals.
5. High stockout frequency(i.e products 1047,8241,1131,4125,5895) each with 19 occurrences. Restocking intervals and
   quantities to meet demand must be adjusted.
6. Top sales occurred in March($221,773), August($211,941) and June($211,941). Use these months to plan big campaigns and
   forcasting stocking.
